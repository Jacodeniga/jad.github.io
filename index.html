            <p>Hello! I'm a passionate student pursuing my dreams in the field of technology. I want to keep learning and improving in my course Computer Science.</p>
            <p>My journey in taking up Computer Science started with a curiosity about how websites work, how games are developed, technology itself, and since then, I've been exploring various programming languages and trying to learn them.</p>
            <p>I want to be able to solve problems and create solutions that make a difference. Aside from that, my hobbies are playing sports such as basketball, chess and playing games.</p>
            <p>My goal is either to become a game or web developer and contribute to meaningful projects that impact people's lives positively.</p>
